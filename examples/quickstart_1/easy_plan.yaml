# Easy Plan is a simple independant plan showing basic concepts

chains: # Chains definitions
# A Chain must declare a name,and at least one task.
- name: FirstChain
  tasks:
  - FirstTask  # This task references a task definition by its name
  - SecondTask # Another one
  - name: ThirdTask_Inline # This task is defined inline, just for this chain.
    kind: CMD
    command: sleep 5


tasks: # Tasks definitions
- name: FirstTask # A task definition must have at least a name, a kind, and specific attibutes for this kind
  kind: CMD # CMD is a kind of task which will execute a command:
  command: sleep 2 #The first term is the executable command, optionnaly followed by some arguments
- name: SecondTask
  kind: CMD
  command: uptime
  deps: # A dep defines a dependecy. The object (chain or task) will start after the deps are resolved. 
  - kind: time # A time dep is resolved after the defined time
    time: 17:44  # In this simple case, the object will start today after 17:44
